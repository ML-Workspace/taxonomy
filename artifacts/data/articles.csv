"Five of Serbiaâ€™s travel highlights. 1. Go boho in Belgrade : You’d never know Belgrade’s best bar, the Federal Association of Globe Trotters, was there unless someone told you. This bohemian den – filled with lamps, sewing machine tables and 1930s portraits – serves great cocktails (usp-aur.rs). To rest your head in style, make for the hip, minimalist Beograd Art Hotel. Fantastically located in the centre of Belgrade, the hotel is just a short walk from the bars and restaurants of the cobbled streets of the neighbourhood of Skadarska, and has great views across the city (http://belgradearthotel.com).",bar
"A guide to the eateries of France. A bar or bar américain (cocktail bar) is an establishment dedicated to elbow-bending and rarely serves food. A bar à vins is a 'wine bar', which often serves full meals at lunch and dinner. A bar à huîtres is an 'oyster bar'.",bar
"Strangest night: weird and wonderful after-dark adventures. A scenic sunrise over Florence, Italy : Unashamedly, my favoured haunts when it comes to nightlife are cheap bars and soulless nightclubs, which play the same brand of insipid chart music regardless of where you are in the world. One night, however, while walking home from one of Florence's clubs at four in the morning, some friends and I were shocked to find the 19th-century Piazzale Michelangelo full of people. Couples, young and old, were gathered around a single accordionist, slowly swaying in time to the musician’s soft melody; arms loose around waists and eyes wrinkled by tired smiles.",bar
"Liquor Rooms. A subterranean cocktail bar decorated in the manner of a Prohibition-era speakeasy.

There's dancing in the Boom Room, classy cocktails in the Blind Tiger Room and art deco elegance in the Mayflower Room.",bar
"Le Passage du Chat Blanc. A trendy crowd flocks to this popular bar with two entrances (one on Rue Jean Chatel, the other on Ruelle Edouard).

"Top spots to sink a drink in Manila. ABV Cocktail and Absinthe Bar : Duck into burger joint Lazy Bastard and head for the antique elevator to find drinking den ABV (abv.ph).

"B & B Bar. Across from the harbor, B & B claims to be Alaska’s oldest bar, having served its first beer in 1899 (its original liquor license is framed on the wall). It’s a fisher's bar with a giant king crab on the wall, as well as the most level pool table in a town that feels an earthquake now and then. Cash only.",bar
24 hours in Cape Town. After Dark : Long St is always pumping with lively bars (lovers of craft beers should head to the Beer House (223 Long St) with 99 offering on tap and in bottles) and clubs such as the roof-top Waiting Room (273 Long St). For something more sophisticated try the cocktail bars Orphanage or Mother’s Ruin on Bree St. Other clubs to try include Assembly (61 Harrington St) in the East City and gay-friendly Crew (30 Napier St) in De Waterkant.,bar
"Sky Train Jazz Club. An evening at this comically misnamed bar is more like chilling at a stoner buddy’s terrace flat than a jazz club. There are indeed views of the BTS, jazz on occasion and a scrappy speakeasy atmosphere. To find it, look for the sign and proceed up the graffiti-strewn stairway past Mitr Bar until you reach the roof.",bar
"Ireland's Toastie Festival celebrates the cosy joy of toasted sandwiches. And if you’re still not convinced about taking the trip, you might be interested in the fact the Harbour Bar was voted the best bar in the world by Lonely Planet in 2010.

"37 Dawson Street. Antiques, eye-catching art and elegant bric-a-brac adorn this bar that quickly established itself as a favourite with the trendy crowd.

"Ho Chi Minh Cityâ€™s best rooftop bars. Bar Bleu : At the top of the trendy Myst hotel on Dong Khoi, Saigon’s ritziest shopping street, lies Bar Bleu. On the smallish side, this 14th-floor rooftop bar shares half its space with a lap pool, illuminated by coloured lights. Wade through the water to the two plush cabanas or go for a dip (permissible for bar patrons) with a cocktail in hand. While there’s a DJ on Friday and Saturday nights, the real reason to come is for its views over the Saigon River as well as its all-you-can-drink specials on select days when women get a discount.",bar
"After hours in Bengaluru: Sipping cocktails and craft brews in India's drinking capital. Bar hop to Bangkok in Bengaluru : Down-home ‘ten table’ bar One Night in Bangkok (facebook.com/onenightinbangkokbangalore) has a sparse menu, a shortage of elbow room and poorly lit interiors, but it’s still easy to sing its praises. For starters, it feels like you’ve stumbled upon a secret – a green velvet curtain parts to reveal a cheerful facsimile of Thailand, complete with a massive Muay Thai mural. Add in cheesy music from the 80s and great pub grub, and it knocks the socks off many of its glitzy neighbours.",bar
"A guide to the eateries of Portugal. Bar : In Portugal you can get a drink at just about any kind of establishment anywhere in the country, so there’s no special reason to go to a bar. Some bars are cafe-bars, where you can have snacks as well as drinks. Others are bars for shaking your booty until the wee hours, although it’s also possible to choose from a small bar menu of a few hot dishes and sandwiches. There’s plenty of nightlife, and Lisbon has a dedicated bar strip down at the Docks, which is quite mad.",bar
"Bar Marsella. Bar Marsella has been in business since 1820, and has served the likes of Dalí, Picasso, Gaudí and Hemingway. The latter was known to slump here over an absenta (absinthe) amid the tiled floors and glinting chandeliers. The bar still specialises in absinthe (€5), a drink to be treated with respect.",bar

"Where to get a drink in Marrakesh. Barometre : The only experimental mixology place in town, Barometre is a do-not-miss of Marrakesh. Because of a dearth of local spirits, the team makes their own infusions that then go into their adventurous signature cocktails. The place has a speakeasy vibe that comes partly from its entrance behind a giant letter B, which then leads you underground past two large doors. Friendly anbd super knowledgeable English-speaking bartenders help you through the entire experience. Not only is Barometre good for cocktails, but the beers on tap and the restaurant also come highly recommended.",bar
"The Georgian capital by night: the best bars and clubs in Tbilisi.

Beer prices are good and there's a wide range of cocktails, Scotch, bourbon and single malt whiskies, plus a range of bar food.",bar
"Berlin's Berghain lures visitors back with an eerie sound art installation. Berlin's nightclub scene has been hit hard by the pandemic. While restaurants, stores and bars have been allowed to reopen, nightclubs have remained closed due to fears that large crowds gathering indoors could lead to increases in infection rates. In order to give some of these venues a lifeline, and to breathe some life back into Berlin after hours, city authorities are calling for major outdoor spaces like parks, streets and squares to be transformed into makeshift open-air night clubs and summer beer gardens. ",bar

"24 hours in Brno. Brno excels at both lively cocktail bars and live music. For the former, most of the action takes place in the centre along Dvořákova ulice. Bar, Který Neexistuje (barkteryneexistuje.cz) – literally 'the bar that doesn’t exist' – boasts a long, beautiful bar backed by every bottle of booze imaginable. For a bar that ‘doesn’t exist’, it gets quite crowded, so book ahead. The nearby Aloha Cocktail Bar & Café (alohabar.cz) is equally popular, though more down to earth.",bar
"The classic US motel is making a comeback, here's why . But the Anvil just so happens to be calibrated for modern tastes. The lobby isn't a dressed-up living room, but a mercantile stocked with well-curated goods. The restaurant and bar is an Instagram-worthy, wood-fired Italian trattoria that serves up fresh takes on classic cocktails. And the location is pure Jackson Hole, a stone's throw from the Tetons and a reasonable drive to Yellowstone.",bar
"Myx. Central Kolkata's best-looking nightclub has a second bar upstairs and a shisha terrace on the rooftop. It's housed in a tower above three upmarket restaurants, hidden behind an easy-to-spot KFC outlet.",bar
"Papa Bar. Centred around a huge wooden bar bristling with alcoholic ordinance, this cocktail bar and restaurant unashamedly proclaims itself 'the best bar in town'. Opinions vary, but there's no disputing the comfort and elegance of the space, or the deliciousness of well-shaken mixtures such as the Wrocław Sling, a refreshing vodka-and-citrus creation.",bar
"Backstage Bar. Chinatown's veteran gay bar has found new life in a converted Neil Rd shophouse, complete with snug alfresco courtyard and a splash of Broadway posters. Very friendly, it's a top spot to chat, flirt or just sit back and people watch. Entry is via the side alley.",bar
"The best LGBT+ bars in London. Comptons of Soho : This Soho stalwart tends to attract a slightly older crowd of gay guys and has a reputation for being cruisy.

"The best places to eat tapas in Barcelona. De Tapa Madre
A few tiny tables line the window of this crowded and chatty tapas bar, but you’ll need to head upstairs, or deeper inside past the bench with the ham legs, for more space. Up here is the gallery, which hovers above the array of tapas on the bar below. The arròs caldós amb llagostins (a hearty rice dish with king prawns) is especially delicious.",bar
"Where to find glow-in-the-dark tacos in London this month.

"The year in Barcelona fiestas. Festival Internacional de Jazz de Barcelona (November) : For the whole of November, and a few days either side, venues such as L'Auditori, Palau de la Música Catalana and the Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, as well as humbler joints like the Harlem Jazz Club, host a plethora of international acts. Mainstays of the programme include Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter and their ilk. At the same time, a more homespun jazz fest takes place for about a month in bars across Ciutat Vella.",bar
"Prinsep Bar. For a quiet drink with a dash of history, try this tiny bar named after James Prinsep, who drew wonderful illustrations of Varanasi’s ghats and temples (look for an 1830 copy of his Benares Illustrated in a glass case here). Stick to beer as the 25ml cocktail pour is weak.",bar
"Long Bar. For a taste of colonial-era Shanghai’s elitist trappings, you’ll do no better than the Long Bar. This was once the members-only Shanghai Club, whose most spectacular accoutrement was a 34m-long wooden bar.

"New York City's most decadent theme bars. Gallery Bar: best gallery bar : As its name suggests, this Lower East Side venue is both a gallery and a bar. In a neighborhood mainly comprised of indie music venues and underground speakeasies, Gallery Bar (gallerybarnyc.com) is a breath of fresh air.

Exhibits change about every two weeks, with opening receptions scheduled for Fridays.",bar

"Salt Lake Cityâ€™s 10 best watering holes. Go below decks at Undercurrent : Perhaps a little too cleverly named, the bar Undercurrent, located adjacent to the swanky seafood joint Current (get it?), is a deliciously civilized place for a lovely glass of this or that. Bar overseer Amy Eldredge apprenticed in New York at Milk & Honey and was on the scene for the beginnings of the craft cocktail revival. She brought her skills to Utah and supervises a tight crew of some of Salt Lake’s best mixologists. With its impressive long, marble bar, subtle nautical theme, Undercurrent is a cultured spot, perfect for conversation and before or after dinner drinks next door at Current.",bar
"Proudest Monkey. This long, narrow bare-brick bar has a fine lineup of Texas microbrews, although nothing is on tap. People like to catch games here while enjoying burgers and tacos.",bar
"Mr Goodbar. If you're looking for Mr Goodbar, you'll find him at this excellent red-brick cocktail bar just off Rundle St in Adelaide's East End. Super-attentive staff really know their product, and can navigate you towards a gin to suit your mood, a high-end Japanese single malt, or perhaps a dark ale to fend off the weather. Soul, funk and '90s hip-hop.",bar
"15 essential things to do on your Irish holiday. In this Victorian-era pub, built into the wall of the cemetery, you won’t find music or TV but that just adds to its charm. The interior has changed little since the bar opened its doors in 1833, with its threadbare wooden tables and weathered bar. It’s a great bar to hang with your friends and recap your day with a pint of Guinness.",bar
"Lamb. Its curved mahogany bar topped with etched-glass ‘snob screens’ (swivelling panels concealing genteel Victorian drinkers from bar staff and other workers) and its walls hung with antique lithographs, The Lamb seems the Platonic ideal of a London pub. Enjoy your Young's bitter on the deep-green upholstered banquettes, or in the walled beer garden in fine weather.",bar
"Bodega Brew Pub. It's hard to argue with an affable, centrally located bar that boasts no fewer than 15 taps, 400 different beers and free popcorn to munch on as you drink.

"The best of Tel Aviv nightlife: where to party in Israel. Just a few blocks away, Kuli Alma is a great bar to swing by while you’re sober enough to appreciate its vibrant murals and rotating art exhibits – enjoy a cocktail on the patio if you’re not ready to hit the dance floor next to the bar downstairs. It’s just one of an increasing number of ‘gallery bars’ that have popped up in Tel Aviv over the past few years; other good stops include subterranean drinking dens BuXa, with its alternative Tokyo vibe, and Radio EPGB, which wouldn’t look out of place in New York’s East Village with its polished wooden bar, moody lighting and graffiti-scribbled walls.",bar
"Best bars to taste that local flavour. Kaertner Bar, Austria : Former capital of the Hapsburg empire, Vienna has some very well-appointed drinking holes. For a really intimate taste of the city, try to get a seat at Kaertner Bar. Lavishly designed by Adolf Loos in 1907, you'd be hard pressed to fit 20 people in here. For the eight who are standing, it's a great recipe for meeting locals. Start with a glass of Austrian wine then move on to Viennese schnapps or fruit liqueurs.",bar
"Tantra. Kolkata’s best-established nightclub has contemporary sounds throbbing through the single small dance floor and a somewhat cramped chill-out zone, appointed around a central island bar with an overhead observation bridge. On Wednesdays, women drink for free until 11pm. On weekends, the place remains open till 2am.",bar
"San Juan's best cocktail bars. La Coctelera, for a chic escape into the gastrobar world : Because it’s disguised as a run-down venue from the outside, it’s hard to believe the pristine interior of La Coctelera. With a clean industrial look and well dressed mixologists (the uniform consists of suspenders, a bowtie, and a beret), it’s obvious this is not your average cocktail bar. They call themselves a gastrobar, and serve high-end food and inventive drinks like the 'Reina de Carnaval', a mix of rum, lime, pineapple and a touch of ginger, and the 'Tesla', made from vodka, limoncello, tonic, and Jenever, served inside a light bulb.",bar
"Joynt. Landmark bar on popular Water St is worth a trip in its own right to admire the photos of the jazz and blues legends who used to play here when it was a music club and some cartoon-art by Robert Crumb. Oh, and the beer is cheap and the vibe is effortlessly cool. Find more on Joynt's Facebook page.",bar
"Pointbar. Like many restaurant-bars in Gueliz, Pointbar's charms are hidden behind a high wall and thickly draped door. Inside, this contemporary tapas bar revolves around a lively open-air courtyard. You have to order something to eat if you want to drink: go for the tasty tortilla, which at Dh30 is a generously sized bargain and the perfect sidekick to cocktails, beer or wine.",bar
"Dudki Bar. Local hipsters love this self-ironic bar, perhaps for the snug, oversized upholstered booths that make you feel like you've got your own little private corner of the universe. The bar has a full menu of mainly European and Asian dishes (mains R300 to R350). There's another branch in Yaroslavl.",bar
"Milwaukee: brewing up a buzz. Milwaukee also has one of the highest bar-per-capita rates in the US. Friendly hangouts abound, such as Best Place in the former Pabst Brewery headquarters, where a fireplace warms the medieval-looking room and staff tell tales of days of yore. At kitschy Kochanski's, hipsters and old-timers alike twirl around the floor to live polka music and swill Polish beers on tap.",bar
"Al Ghazal Bar. More of a pub than a bar, this is a popular expat-meeting place, with live music, a quiz night, televised sport and excellent Western-style bar food.",bar
"Casaluxo Bar. Most Diu bars are wholly unappealing places full of Gujarati men downing whisky and falling over, but at the almost pub-like Casaluxo Bar, facing the town square, there's a (slightly) more salubrious air. It opened in 1963 and, except for some swimsuit posters in the back room, might not have updated its decor since.",bar
"18th Amendment Bar. Named after the law that banned alcohol in the USA in the 1920s, this Prohibition-style bar is a much-loved fixture along Little Malop. Its dark, low-lit space with exposed wooden beams and pressed-metal bar lends the perfect character. Choose your tipple, from a barrel-aged negroni to a Boardwalk Empire – served in a smoke-filled treasure chest. Table service keeps things classy.",bar
"Bar do Serafim. On a lively stretch of Rua Alice, the Bar do Serafim is a simple, convivial boteco serving tasty Portuguese appetizers and plenty of chope (draft beer). It’s been around since 1944, and remains an institution and a popular happy-hour spot among neighborhood regulars.",bar
"Harry's Bar. On your right as you enter town, Harry's Bar boasts a historic well (serving as a table within the bar itself), an aquarium and maritime bric-a-brac. It has been in the same family since 1870.",bar
"Galaxy. Once upon a time (1972 to be exact), this was a modern bar – the sort with an actual European-style bar. Now it's a worn-at-the-edges but atmospheric time capsule with gallant bartenders who respect the spirit of the place, which can be summarised in the framed photos of the Rat Pack and Franz Kafka. It's at the end of the arcade.",bar
"Discover the best new cocktail bars around the world.

"Chicago honors its place in the history of magic with a new speakeasy lounge. Part-performance cabaret and part-speakeasy bar, this enchanting club in the heart of one of the USA’s biggest cities is hidden behind a laundromat.

"Rhiz. Rhiz’ brick arches and glass walls are reminiscent of many bars beneath the U6 line, but its status as a stalwart of the city’s electronica scene gives it the edge over the competition.

"Ho Chi Minh Cityâ€™s best rooftop bars. Saigon Saigon Bar : Looking out over the heart of downtown from the 9th floor of the Caravelle Hotel, Saigon Saigon Bar is arguably the city’s most historic drinking hole.

"La Carafe. Set in Houston's oldest building (1848 or thereabouts), La Carafe has to be the city’s most atmospheric bar. It's a warmly lit drinking den, with exposed brick, sepia photos on the walls and flickering candles. You'll also find a great jukebox and a friendly, eclectic crowd. On weekends, the upstairs bar room opens, with a 2nd-floor balcony overlooking Market Sq.",bar
"16 essential San Francisco experiences. Sip a cocktail at a Barbary Coast bar : Friendly bartenders were once highly suspect in Barbary Coast, San Francisco’s Gold Rush–era red-light district. Circa 1849, a night that began with smiles and a 10-cent whiskey could end two days later, waking from a drugged sleep on a vessel bound for Patagonia. Now that double-crossing barkeep Shanghai Kelly is no longer a danger to drinkers, San Franciscans can relax over historically correct cocktails at North Beach’s revived Barbary Coast saloons, including Comstock Saloon, Devil’s Acre and 15 Romolo. Today’s saloon scene is a fitting homage to drunken sailors of yore, with iron stools, absinthe fountains, dim lighting and reassuring barkeep banter.",bar

Situated in a refurbished heritage building that has retained its vintage fit-out and has a ""Soho House vibe,"" the bar and hotel run as separate entities.

Today it’s a popular live music venue.",bar

The cocktail menu changes seasonally to make use of the best local fruits and flavours, but standouts include the booze-heavy Comte De Monte Cristo, made with aged rum, Ethiopian coffee and pecan-infused port wine.

"This NYC bar only serves drinks from alcohol companies run by women. Take the bar’s namesake cocktail, ‘The Moga’ for example; a blend of Japanese whiskey, rhum, plum liqueur and bitters. For every cocktail sold, a dollar will be donated to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation or American Civil Liberties Union. A drink with a dash of good karma? We’ll take it. Sticking on theme, the bar menu also features wines from predominantly female winemakers. While stocks last, order the Suo Red Collection No. 2 2013 ($17/glass, $70/bottle) which is a joint venture between the world’s first black female winemaker, Ntiski Biyela, and Napa Valley’s Helen Keplinger.",bar
"Inside Californiaâ€™s new trailer park-themed bar and restaurant. The bar stocks cocktails and 40oz bottles of Olde English malt liquor served in a paper bag.

"10 after 10: Perth's best late-night dining. The basement bar serving lobster toasties : Halford Bar (halfordbar.com.au) is a decadent cocktail haven squirreled away in the Safe Room of the circa 1897 WA government Titles Office. Hefty, steel bank-safe shutters are still on the windows. Nowadays, it’s a velvety, 1950s lounge bar that sits beneath the pavement, glinting with gold-mirror tabletops, gold-hued furniture and gold-patterned floors, lit with artful illumination specially created by a lighting pro at the State Theatre Centre of Western Australia. The kitchen stays open until midnight Monday to Wednesday and rocks on until 2am Thursday to Saturday, serving cured meats, fancy cheeses and the pick of the bunch: the crayfish with dill and salmon roe mayonnaise on brioche.",bar
"Get your disco on as you dine at NYCâ€™s revamped Legacy Records. The first of the restaurant’s two bars is emerald, mahogany and shaped like a horseshoe.

The scarlet-hued bar upstairs (named Ada’s Place) boasts a mural depicting artist Chris Lux’ interpretation of Marvin Gaye’s classic I Want You album cover.",bar
"Pioneer Bar. The ‘P-Bar’ is Alaska’s classic maritime watering hole. The walls are covered with photos of fishing boats and their crews, big fish and a blackboard with messages like ‘Experienced deckhand looking for seine job.’ Don’t ring the ship’s bell over the bar unless you’re ready to buy every crew member a drink.",bar
"The best LGBT+ bars in London. The Yard Bar : This Soho bar’s main draw is its al fresco courtyard, which fills up pretty quickly on fine days. The upstairs lounge bar is a bit less characterful, but opens onto Soho’s best smoking area, so The Yard is a strong option whatever the weather.",bar
"Glasgow's ten best pubs and bars. There aren’t many pubs in Glasgow where you can expect to find such an eclectic mix of people. From the old guys you feel have been there for centuries to students preparing for a big night out, locals and visitors alike are all here for the same thing – no fuss drinks and a welcoming Glaswegian atmosphere in the legendary home of ‘Europe’s longest’ bar. An American company once tried to buy the entire contents of the pub (including the original fixtures and fittings) and ship it all to New York, demonstrating the Horseshoe’s international appeal. The offer was, thankfully, turned down.",bar
"Nestor. There is plenty of craftsmanship on show at this low-lit bar with exposed brass pipes, polished wood-veneer bar tops and Edison light globes to transport you to another era. Indeed the classic 1920s cocktails have the right balance of whiskey, bourbon and scotch and the craft beers on tap are also good.",bar
"Duda Bar. There's a cool vibe to this colorful bar occupying the 1st floor of an elegant old building in the city center. Under plaster arches and between pillars you'll find retro furniture, badminton rackets and the odd garden gnome. Come for cocktails or beers.",bar
Smoke â€˜nâ€™ Barrel. This bar is all about its outside space. Wooden seating and planks behind a long bar create a homey atmosphere – join expats and locals to sip on beers and drinks.,bar
"Brothers Beer. This beer bar combines quirky decor with 18 taps crammed with Brothers' own brews and guest beers from NZ and further afield. Hundreds more bottled beers are chilling in the fridges, and bar food includes pizza. There are occasional movie and comedy nights, and beers are available to take away. The adjacent City Works Depot has other good eating options.",bar
"Clover Irish Bar. This cosy place has all of the requirements: a large variety of whiskies behind the bar, dark wood-panelled walls and a profusion of orange-and-green decorations. The only thing missing? The Irish bartender.",bar
"Pivnitsa. This dark Czech cellar-bar – stone walls, wooden booths and long wood tables – is a convivial place for mugs of the unfiltered house beer, Kelly (800T for 0.5L), which comes in two types: light and dark. There are also sausages, steaks and other meaty fare to soak it up. The bar is entered from the riverside just below the Radisson Hotel.",bar
"Coogee Bay Hotel. This enormous, rambling, rowdy complex packs in the backpackers for live music, open-mic nights, comedy and big-screen sports in the beaut beer garden, sports bar and Selina's nightclub. Sit on a stool at the window overlooking the beach and sip on a cold one.",bar
"Cottonâ€™s. This excellent bar is one of the most pleasant spots in the concession to raise a glass. Ensconced in a converted 1930s villa, the bar's interior has cosy sofas and fireplaces to snuggle around in the winter, and a tiny outdoor terrace on the 2nd floor. The real draw, though, is the garden, which is intimate yet still big enough not to feel cramped.",bar
"Disneyland gets its first-ever brewery with 50 different craft beers. This family-friendly eatery has a nautical theme and its rooftop features festive lighting and cabana-style seating, all offering views of the Downtown Disney District. The main bar wall is inspired by the hull of a ship, and it has a bistro wall of sketches from Ballast Point’s resident artist, Paul Elders, which illustrate labels of notable beers over the years, from haunting seaworthy skeletons to a mystical octopus.",bar
Casa Marta. This is a great tapas bar that brims with people of all ages both inside and out: outdoor seating is under a tent in the street. Free tapas are included with drinks (from €2.50); larger plates are available from the menu.,bar
"Bar Open. This long-established bar is often open when everything else is closed, as the name suggests. The bar attracts a relaxed, young local crowd and bands play in the upstairs loft most nights and are almost always free.",bar
"Papagayo. This neat-looking restaurant, bar and nightclub oozes sophistication and good taste – it's the coolest on the strip. The decor is predominantly white, with kick-back seating facing the sunset, shady canopies and a menu that's best for light dishes such as sushi. Come night-time the place shifts into fashionable nightclub mode, complete with slick professional DJs.",bar
"55 Bar. This shabby and largely undecorated place is the only bar in town, with a fridge of beers, but no draft ales. It's usually pretty quiet and is very discreet, with no sign outside. Look for the white saloon swing doors at No 55.",bar
"Bodega del Barbero. Tucked down a narrow street, this intimate bar has a wide range of vino by the glass, good tapas, regular art exhibitions and live music on the outside terrace on summer weekends.",bar
"The Club at Koi. Up on the 39th floor of a business district high-rise, this hip nightclub spans a lounge, bar and restaurant, and has a dance floor that could potentially pack in a mini army of jivers. Expect an entry fee of 300B on Fridays and Saturdays, a clear indication of its popularity with the city's nightbirds.",bar
"Ice Bar. Upstairs at the Jetpoint shopping complex, Ice Bar is Nadi's most happening nightclub. Things can get a little crazy (ahem, impromptu pole dancing), but staff pride themselves on making sure punters stay safe: they'll even shuttle you back to your digs at stumps. For a pre-club puff, hit the Tantra Hookah Lounge within the same complex.",bar
"Beer Bazaar. What began as a craft beer stand in the Carmel Market has now turned into an empire. Well, maybe a mini-empire. Beer Bazaar has four locations in Tel Aviv and one in Jerusalem’s Mahane Yehuda Market. In this bar, try tastings from an impressive range of 100 Israeli craft beers before choosing your pint. The shop also sells bottles.",bar
"How to do the Great Barrier Reef on a budget. Day trips : Green Island is a tiny coral cay with only one resort. Luckily, the resort has restaurants, an ice cream parlour and watersports rentals that are all available to day trippers. It only takes about 30 minutes to walk around the light sands of this beautiful island, so chances are you’ll spend a lot of time enjoying the crystal blue waters and fringing coral reef, or simply lounge the day away on the beach. Great Adventures (greatadventures.com.au) runs the least expensive ferry option at around AU$90 return.",beach
"Sun, sea, and Schiermonnikoog: which Frisian Island is right for you?. The tourist office also organises several nature expeditions.

It’s a messy undertaking, but it is a unique way to explore this extraordinary ecosystem.",beach
"Travelers can now swim above this heart-shaped reef in Australia. The three-hour excursion begins with a 30-minute helicopter ride that departs from Hamilton Island and cruises over the Whitsundays, giving a birds-eye view of jewels like Whitehaven Beach and Hill Inlet before arriving at its final destination. Upon landing, travelers have 90 minutes to look around, and while diving and snorkeling on the reef itself remain prohibited, a small glass-bottom boat tours around the heart, and there’s plenty of coral to check out in the neighboring lagoon’s crystal-clear waters. The pontoon itself also has a pool, albeit shallow and undercover, alongside contemporary decor, eco-friendly wind- and solar-powered operations, and a generous supply of snacks and sparkling wine. ",beach

"Summer in Den Haag: a guide to South Holland's beaches. A beach within reach : On warm days in mid-summer – or even not so warm days – Den Haag’s masses hop on their bikes or board trams to languish upon these sands, typically planting themselves in front of one of the dozens of strandclubs that line the rear edge of the beach. The broad esplanade – dotted with inviting sky-blue benches – is for admiring the scene. Above the esplanade a two-lane bicycle thoroughfare offers another way to caress the shoreline.",beach
"The most epic surf spots in the US according to pros. ""A broad stretch of sandy beach that draws the most consistent swell on Long Island, Ditch Plains has been a surfing mecca, of sorts, since the early 1960s. In summer, the waves are silky, warm and predictably packed; in winter, they are mind-bendingly freezing, but can get ridiculously good. And the scene in the water is as entertaining as on land: I once found myself in the lineup with five male models who were in town celebrating a famous Hollywood producer friend’s 40th birthday. The models wanted to go surfing, so I took them. I also took their waves, while they struggled with their 9ft soft-tops. ",beach

"North Rustico Beach. A large, red-sand beach that's free to visit, even in summer, and since it's west-facing, makes a pleasant place for watching the sunset.",beach
"Ask the experts: where to go in August. A spectacle of another kind awaits in Singapore, where a hat-trick of festivals and events ensures a lively month for visitors. Ditto Ljubljana, the tongue-twisting capital of Slovenia, which is primed to celebrate its Roman roots. Spanish cities, meanwhile, become ghost towns as the heat of summer sends the populace to the coast. Follow the exodus for chilled out days, serious siestas, and sandy beaches. The beaches are busy in Maine, too, as the state's famous lobster festival gets underway.",beach
"Russky Island. Access to the island is by bus over the suspension bridge. Take a northbound bus 29 or bus 15 from Okeansky pr or ul Aksakovskaya. The more-frequent bus 15 takes you to the DVFU campus, from which you can transfer to a minibus 29, which makes a loop, stopping in Rynda and other spots on the island. Rynda has a couple of resorts and the best beaches (just hop out when you see one you like). There are many forts on the island, including the Voroshilov Battery.",beach

"Ocean Beauty. Aimed squarely at honeymooners, this hotel is boutique in the sense of having an intimate feel, but it's also basic: the rooms are stylish and atmospheric, but there's very little else to the hotel. Despite this, it's a great spot for romance – breakfast is served on your balcony and there's direct access to the lovely town beach.",beach
"Air Whitsunday Seaplanes. Air Whitsunday offers a range of tours aboard Cessna and de Havilland seaplanes, from flyovers of the Outer Reef, where you don't leave the aircraft (which nonetheless performs a 'touch-n-go' water landing en route, just for thrills) to excursions landing at Whitehaven Beach and Heart Reef, where passengers disembark to snorkel, sightsee and bliss out.",beach
"Alankuda Beach. Alankuda is the peninsula's busiest and best beach for non-kitesurfing beach bums. If you squint your eyes and blot out the string of giant wind turbines stretched right out along the length of the beach, the massive coal-fired power plant at the far end and its long and ugly jetty, then Alankuda is a lovely stretch of sand.",beach
"Waimanalo Bay Beach Park. Also known as Sherwood Forest, as a gang likening themselves to Robin Hood and his merry men operated here in the 1960s, this broad sandy beach backed by ironwood trees is spectacular, popular with surfers and bodyboarders. Countless weddings take place on the enchanting strand. There are lifeguards, campsites and restrooms. Entrance is opposite the Honolulu Polo Club. At research time Native Hawaiian protests against planned development were taking place, but access to the beach park was not disrupted.",beach
"Live like you're on Love Island in these Cape Town villas. Apostles Views : Located in the uber-exclusive suburb of Bakoven, close to the beaches of Camps Bay and the sheltered strands of Clifton (tip: head for the 4th Beach, it's the only one with a blue flag along Victoria Rd) this open-plan villa is ideal for families or a large group of friends. Like all the other villas, it comes with a pool and fantastic views. The ocean can be seen from every level of the house and because the neighbourhood is so quiet, chances of falling asleep to the sound of crashing waves are pretty high. The house has nine en-suite bedrooms and can sleep up to 18 people.",beach
"Top 7 beaches in Georgia for families, dog lovers and seashell seekers. As the morning wears on, the beach fills with kids building sandcastles and cyclists pedaling across the hard-packed sand.

In summer it’s effectively transformed into a buzzing little resort, with a string of hip restaurants and bars lining the waterfront.",beach
"The foodie's guide to Fiji. At Namale honeymooners have the choice of a romantic seaside cave or a secluded spot on the beach at sunset for their evening meal. For the rest of us, sampling from your breakfast tray in a beachfront bure (wood-and-straw hut) with the sound of waves lapping on the shore, or the rare coconut falling on the soft white sand nearby, makes room service pretty memorable.",beach
"Mother Ivey's Bay. Backed by a large caravan park and accessed from the coast path, this small beach is a little off the beaten track, and mainly used by campers and caravanners – but the lack of facilities means it's generally a bit quieter than its neighbours. According to local lore, it was named after a local wise woman and witch who once lived nearby.",beach
"Plage de Grande Anse. Beach lovers should stop at Plage de Grande Anse, which is framed with basaltic cliffs and features a white-sand beach, a protected tide pool and picnic shelters. On weekends, the beach is often swamped with locals. Note that it's not safe to swim outside the tide pool due to unpredictable currents (and sharks).",beach
"The best of Tel Aviv nightlife: where to party in Israel. Beach parties : Tel Aviv's beaches can feel like one big party on weekend days. Come nightfall, however, the beaches also play host to more organised revelry on an even larger scale. The action is usually centred between Hilton Beach and Gordon Beach, including Frischmann and Bograshov Beaches in between – keep your eyes peeled around town for posters advertising upcoming beach parties. More permanent fixtures include (from north to south) Shalvata, near the port, the day-to-night beach bars on Metzitzim Beach, Gordon Beach and Banana Beach and the enormous Clara Beach Bar, at the site of Tel Aviv’s former dolphinarium club.",beach
"I learned how in San Francisco: five cheap or free life skills you never knew you needed. Beachcombing may be a summer activity elsewhere, but winter low tides reveal mollusks galore here – and winter is prime Dungeness crab season in San Francisco. But no matter when you plan your adventure, dress warmly and with a waterproof layer. The Pacific Ocean is chilly year-round, and there’s no telling when the fog will roll in.",beach
"Seeking silence on Moroccoâ€™s wild west coast in Oualidia. Beachcombing : Oualidia’s crescent-shaped lagoon is seven miles long, with toffee-coloured sand lining much of its shore. That means ample space, which, combined with an average 320 days of sun per year and gentle waters protected from Atlantic winds by two rocky promontories, makes swimming and sunbathing a virtual must. In between these horizontal pursuits, go for a stroll to absorb the daydreamy vibe: you’ll pass below a crumbling kasbah and former ruler Mohammed V’s ruined summer palace, and meet beginner surfers, darting swallows, football-playing children and melancholy men in airy kaftans. Opposite is a tidal island, at least until it mostly disappears, like a mirage. In fact, the landscape seems to constantly be shifting, especially magical at sunset. Find a nice spot, and watch as the lagoon turns a silvery pink and silhouetted fishing crafts putter back to shore.",beach
"Best things to do with kids in England. Beaches : Taking a bucket and spade to the seaside is an essential pastime for English children. The beaches range from golden sands backed by peaceful forest to windswept stretches of pebbles below towering cliffs. The most dramatic beaches are found on the southwest coast, where you can swap splashing in the ocean for combing the beach for shells and heart-shaped rocks. For fossil-hunting, head to the world-renowned Jurassic Coast in Dorset, which has beautiful big-hitters including Durdle Door and Lulworth Cove, not far from the lively beach cities of Bournemouth and Weymouth, each with their own aquariums. ",beach
"Plage de Vaiava. Beloved by locals, Plage du PK18 is a stunning beach to sun yourself on, but not that great for swimming or snorkelling due to the shallow water. The sands can get jammed on weekends, but that’s part of the scene.",beach
"The 6 best beaches in Minneapolis. Best beach for energetic city life : Ask a local about the most popular beach in town, and they’ll tell you to hit up Thomas Beach on Bde Maka Ska, the largest lake in Minneapolis. Here, you’ll find city folk and suburbanites alike. Hammocks are strung up between trees, coolers are filled with goodies, and plenty of pop-up lawn games dot the nearby grass on a sunny day. While the actual sand part of the beach isn’t so big, there’s plenty of green space behind it, meaning you’ll never have to stress over finding a spot.",beach
"Here's how to explore Havanaâ€™s best neighborhoods . Beyond the beaches, this neighborhood has little in the way of sights, but plenty to prick your curiosity. Untouched yet by suburban sprawl, Guanabo prefers to see itself as a traditional Cuban village where spontaneous reggaeton parties erupt on the sand and horse and cart is still the preferred method of getting around. ",beach
"Myrtle Beach with kids. Classic family water activities include boogie boarding on pitch perfect waves, building sandcastles at low tide or cruising around your hotel’s lazy river (the slow-flowing pools usually found in water parks are a popular addition to many hotels in Myrtle Beach).",beach
"The 10 best beaches in Sri Lanka. Dalawella : Just east of Unawatuna, much-photographed Frog Rock presides over Dalawella’s slender champagne sands.

It’s a super spot for families, particularly as curious turtles often make an appearance.",beach
"10 blissful beaches on Long Island. Ditch Plains Beach : Two miles past Montauk, at the very edge of Long Island, cliff-side views and swells collide at Ditch Plains Beach.

"An Italian island will refund your stay if it rains too much. Elba Island is the largest island found by the coast of Tuscany, and the third largest of the Italian islands after Sicily and Sardinia.

"Spreckelsville Beach. Extending west from HA Baldwin Beach, this 2-mile stretch of sand is a good walking beach. Its nearshore reef makes it less than ideal for swimming, but it does provide protection for young kids. If you walk toward the center of the beach you’ll soon come to a section dubbed 'Baby Beach.’",beach
"Exploring South Beach. For a different scene, head back up shore. South Beach gets noticeably fancy(er) once you cross north of 15th Street. Newer hotels are built with towering skylines and could have pride of place in an MTV advertisement. If you want to see South Beach at her most opulent, wander into the lobby and pool areas of the Delano and the Shore Club. These spots are open to the public, but you should be a polite visitor and buy a drink at one the bars peppered throughout both hotels. Or wet your whistle at Kill Your Idol, a punk-chic South Beach bar with graffiti art, rough edges and a crowd full of Europeans, fashion models and the painfully hip.",beach
"Four ways to experience the beaches of Fort Myers & Sanibel.

"Sandy Ground. Fronting bobbing yachts and a couple of small piers, this golden-sand beach is calm, shallow and free from coral, making it a good spot to splash about. Snorkeling is best at the rocky northern end – keep an eye out for sea turtles; Scuba Shack rents gear. The beach bars and restaurants here draw plenty of punters, especially on weekends, when live bands often play.",beach
"How to get around Havana, from vintage Chevys to bicycle rickshaws. Get a tour plus transport on the sightseeing bus : Like many big cities, Havana has its own hop-on, hop-off double-decker bus service called the Havana Bus Tour that runs on two main routes throughout the day. The open-topped T1 takes in most of the tourist sights in Centro Habana, Vedado, and Miramar. The single-story T3 runs to the beaches of Playas del Este via the city’s historic forts. Both have their main terminus in Parque Central opposite the Hotel Inglaterra and depart every 20 to 30 minutes. All-day tickets cost the equivalent of US$10 and must be paid for by credit card (no cash) on entering the bus.",beach
"Lonely Planet's best beaches in Europe 2015. Getting there is half the fun: the beach is a four-mile walk from the nearest road, the path winding through moorland and grassy sand dunes. When the view of the mile-long beach, overlooked by the limestone sea stack of Am Buachaille, finally opens up it feels like ample reward. This sweep of sand has cliffs around it, a freshwater loch at its back and faces on to waters that stretch to the Arctic. Tall tales of ghosts, shipwrecks and mermaids add garnish, but most people find a tramp around this beautiful place poetic enough.",beach
"Grande Anse. This superb golden-sand beach with no hotel development in sight is just 2km north of Deshaies. This is one of Basse-Terre's longest and prettiest stretches of sand. The place is no secret, though, and you won’t be alone, but it’s easy to escape the crowds by walking down the bay. However, with children you should head to the middle of the beach, where the waves are least powerful. Restaurants and cafes cluster around the parking lot.",beach
"Piscines Naturelles d'Ambodiatafana. In the north of Sainte Marie, near Ambodiatafana village, these natural pools are separated from the Indian Ocean by a granitic gate of about 100m. During each tide, the sea fills these natural basins by crashing against the rocks. The ocean is too rough to swim there from June to September but they're absolutely idyllic in spring and summer (October to February). There are phenomenal panoramic views of the island from the sand dunes at the back of the beach.",beach
"Why Central America is great for budget travelers. Island life is more expensive, so head for mainland beaches : There are plenty of island idylls in Central America, with icing sugar–soft white sand lapped by crystalline waters, from the car-free islands of Caye Caulker in Belize and Nicaragua’s Little Corn to the palm-fringed sand circles that make up Panama’s San Blas archipelago. But island life comes with a higher price tag even before the puddle-jumper flight to get there. so with miles of beaches along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts, bus it to a nearby shore instead. As alternatives, consider Placencia in Belize, Playa Maderas in Nicaragua and remote Santa Catalina in Panama.",beach
"La Marsa Beach. Join the local crowds flocking to this urban beach to escape the summer heat with a dip in the clear waters of the Med. In colder months, the sand becomes a playground for fishermen, footballers and romantics taking afternoon strolls along the shoreline. It might not be the cleanest of beaches, but the view to Gammarth is charming, and there are a number of decent cafes nearby.",beach

"Maui's best beaches for swimming, snorkeling and soaking up the sun. Kayaks are lined up smartly beside the ocean in the early morning, ready for daily tours, while power walkers stride past on the paved Wailea Beach Walk, a 1.3-mile shoreline path.

Remember, the sand is open to all, so don't feel put off claiming your own piece of beach real estate.",beach
"Beyond Tel Aviv: road-tripping Israel's north coast. Laze amid nature Akhziv National Park : Ten kilometres beyond Akko basks the popular resort town of Nahariya, but true paradise is just a bit further north: Akhziv National Park has glassy lagoons, sheltered coves and beach campsites where families can step straight from their tents into the Mediterranean Sea. Protected under national park designation since 1968, the variegated shoreline comprises pebbled inlets, natural pools and coves spangled with starfish and sea anemones. It’s also a nesting site for loggerhead and green sea turtles, and visitors in July and August might be lucky enough to glimpse baby turtles being returned to the sea by local breeding programmes.",beach
"Nishibama Beach. Lovely beaches fringe every side of the island, but for sheer postcard-perfect beauty, it's hard to beat the 1km stretch of white sand on the northeast coast known as Nishibama Beach. It can be crowded in summer; if you want privacy, there are quieter beaches on the other sides of the island.",beach
"Miami Beach. Miami Beach (pronounced me-ami) has a sheltered cove with a water slide and jungle gym set up in the sea for kids to frolic on, but note that these get impossibly, almost comically, crowded during peak season. The beach is 12.5km east of Midan Saad Zaghloul along the Corniche.",beach
"Shela Beach. Most people are here for the beach – a 12km-long, wide sweep of pristine white sand where you’re guaranteed an isolated spot (at least if you’re prepared to walk some way) to catch some rays. Swimming is possible, but there are places with strong rip currents (particularly around the The Fort hotel), so get some local advice before venturing into the water.",beach
"The top 19 beaches in South Africa for sand, surf and scenery. Nearby Camps Bay, another Blue Flag beach, with soft white sand and a backdrop of the spectacular Twelve Apostles range (part of Table Mountain), is one of the city’s most popular beaches, and it gets very crowded. It’s also one of the windiest, though on a windless day, the dazzling sand-and-sea scene is pure magic.",beach
"Stanley Beach. On a tiny bay with the old Stanley Bridge soaring above it, this beach has a modest patch of sand for bathing backed by three levels of beach cabins. The sight of the sea crashing against the bridge’s concrete supports is dramatic, but this beach is not very suitable for kids because of the waves. It gets overcrowded in summer.",beach
"nan. On a warm summer day in Rio de Janeiro, I set out for a slow run along the famous Copacabana Beach. The soft sand and crashing waves made for a soothing and refreshing workout.",beach
"Es Cavallet. On the eastern side of a slender peninsula, the wonderful, wild-feel, salt-white beach of Es Cavallet is one of the island's most perfect strips of sand. It was designated Ibiza’s first naturist beach in 1978; today it's the island's main gay beach. The northern section is more family-geared, while the southern half is almost exclusively gay.",beach
"Paliku Beach. Once unofficially known as a nudists' playground, this scenic beach is rarely swimmable, but the rugged and isolated terrain makes for fun beachcombing and rock collecting along the water's edge, where windswept ironwood trees and naupaka and 'ilima flowers add dashes of color. Even if summer swells look manageable, stay ashore unless you are an experienced ocean swimmer.",beach
"Singapore's best places to sling yourself into. Once you’re on the island, you can follow some fantastic hiking trails along the coast, passing wetlands that are home to the likes of fiddler crabs, mudskippers and red junglefowl.

There’s a mountain bike path (and bikes for rent) and several campsites if you want to stay overnight under the stars.",beach
"Katergo Beach. One of Folegandros' loveliest beaches, the Katergo Beach cove is great for sunbathing, though swimming to the nearby islet is not recommended due to strong currents. Take a boat from Karavostasis (€8 return) or do the lovely 1km hike through the countryside, followed by a steep scramble down to the beach.",beach
"Crane Beach. One of the longest, widest, sandiest beaches in the region is Crane Beach, with 5.5 miles of fine-sand barrier beach on Ipswich Bay. It is set in the midst of the Crane Wildlife Refuge, so the entire surrounding area is pristine and beautiful. Five miles of trails traverse the dunes. The only downside is the pesky greenhead flies that buzz around (and bite) in late July and early August.",beach

"Muizenberg Beach. Popular with families, this surf beach is famous for its row of colourfully painted Victorian bathing chalets. Surfboards can be hired and lessons booked at several shops along Beach Rd. The beach shelves gently and the sea is generally safer here than elsewhere along the peninsula.",beach
"Bean Hollow State Beach. Pretty sand beaches speckle the coast, though one of the most interesting places to stop is Pebble Beach, a jewel less than 2 miles south of Pescadero Creek Rd (and part of Bean Hollow State Beach). The shore is awash with bite-sized eye candy of agate, jade and carnelian, and sandstone troughs are pockmarked by groovy honeycombed formations called tafoni.",beach
"Discover the best things to do in Dorset, from finding fossils to coastal hikes. Relax on Bournemouth Beach : It may be one of Dorset’s most popular beaches, but Bournemouth is still one of the best places for a day at the seaside. And with seven miles of soft sand to relax on, avoiding the summer crowds is easy. Locals head west towards Branksome Chine or east to Boscombe and Southbourne. At the far eastern end of the bay, the cliff-backed pebble beach at Hengistbury Head has a wilder feel and is often much quieter.",beach

Perhaps the most popular house of worship in modern Mumbai is the Mount Mary Church on Mount Mary Rd in Bandra, established by native Koli fishermen and women who converted to Christianity in colonial times. In the same area is the oldest standing structure in Bandra, St Andrew’s Church, founded in 1575 by Portuguese colonists almost a century before the British gained a foothold in Mumbai.",church

From the sprawling structure of Saviour of the World Church built-in 1586 to the 250-year-old Casa Alvares mansion.  The Church is riddled with a turbulent past, being demolished once. Legend has it that the church was initially built on the site of a demolished temple so it had to be shifted to where it stands today. It was then raided by an army of ants, after which the Priest placed the picture of Savior of the World at the construction site and miraculously, the ants disappeared. With its north-facing facade and ornamental interiors, the church is a central landmark in the village. ",church

"Sabua Gaba. Right by the waterfront, a 10-minute walk west of the speedboat jetty, the most expensive rooms here are swish by Jailolo standards: spacious, modern and well-kept with decent bathrooms. The cheaper singles are set around a sheltered communal area and are clean but small with mandi (ladle bath) bathroom.",expensive
"Lodge at Uxmal. Rooms could be nicer for the price, but you can’t beat the easy access to the ruins, and the pool certainly adds value. Some of the more expensive rooms have Jacuzzis. We don’t suppose Stephens and Catherwood enjoyed such luxury when they passed through the area in the late 1830s. Private guides to the ruins are available for M$800.",expensive

"Inside the worldâ€™s most expensive luxury hotel suites. Taking overwater bungalows to a whole deeper level, The Muraka Suite at Conrad Maldives Rangali Island lets you sleep in a master bedroom submerged more than 16-feet below sea level in the Indian Ocean. It is a first-of-its-kind and costs $50,000 per night but with a four-night minimum stay, it is actually the most expensive suite on our list as you’ll be shelling out at least $200,000 to stay. Still, that rate includes a lot of cool perks from 24-hour access to a personal chef to a film crew who will document all your adventures.  ",expensive
"Shangrila Indus View. The budget rooms are overpriced as they lack a view and show wear and tear. The deluxe rooms are rather similar but do have wire-screened verandas and a river view. The VIP rooms have attractive mock-traditional décor of mud walls, double beds and a tub in the bathroom, and are definitely the best rooms in Chilas. All rooms are air cooled. The recommended restaurant has Pakistani, Chinese and Continental cuisine.",expensive
"Bhavyam Heritage. The cheaper rooms are windowless but large and super clean; the more expensive ones are smaller, but have windows and balconies looking over town towards the palace. The pure veg (no eggs) rooftop restaurant catches the breeze and is a great place to veg-out in the evening. This hotel is right under the fort up a steep narrow alley.",expensive

The island’s most expensive property, this impressive resort has amazing mountaintop views of the sea, but the rooms are overpriced for what they are: unexciting and smallish, albeit perfectly comfortable and clean.

Tokyo had been the world’s most expensive city until 2013.

With four European cities in the top 10, three – Zurich, Oslo and Geneva – are found outside the Eurozone, with Paris as the only top 10 city to use the currency. In general, currencies have a major effect on the rankings; the weak US dollar caused New York to drop four places to 13th and no other US cities made the top 10. LA came just behind New York in 14th place.",expensive

Although not the height of luxury, rooms are colourful, comfy, spacious and serviceable, with modern, clean beds, and the restaurant has a reputation for fine food, with an emphasis on meat dishes (mains from CFA5200).

"Dweik 3 Hotel. An excellent midrange hotel with a great location close to all the action. Rooms are generously sized and well kept, and those at the front have pleasant balconies. Not to be confused with the nearby Dweik 1 and Dweik 2 Hotels.",hotel
"Aria. An oasis of green lawns in the scorched field surrounding the airport, this stylish hotel offers better value than its city equivalents and is a great option if you've got a badly timed flight. There's an excellent pool lined with loungers, and a huge kids' playground. Airport transfers are included.",hotel
"HÃ´tel Les Flamboyants. An old, but well-kept concrete-box hotel done moderately well, with air-conditioning that is welcome in summer. Rooms are large, and some have decent balconies (add an extra Ar5000), but the hot water struggles at times. The restaurant conjures up tasty meals.",hotel
"Hotel Ferdinand. Arguably the best three-star hotel in town. Nothing fancy, just a well-run property in a smart, nicely restored 1930s townhouse. Rooms have fridges and big, comfy beds. The hotel is within easy walking distance of virtually everything, including the city beach. Mamaia-bound maxitaxis leave from across the street.",hotel

Advance reservations required; pick-ups available from some motels and hotels.",hotel
"Fahadan Museum Hotel. Arranged around delicately painted courtyards, this beautiful little establishment is more museum than hotel and some of the rooms are exquisite. With a flamboyant, moustachioed manager, a location in the heart of the old city, a popular teahouse in the main courtyard and a rooftop with spectacular views, this is one hotel that's well worth booking in advance.",hotel
"Airport Lodge. As uninspiring as its name may be, Airport Lodge actually has a lot going for it. It's close to the airport and wharf, the hotel rooms are huge and clean (the cute enclosed garden fale are smaller but perfectly serviceable) and it's a lot cheaper than nearby resorts, though meals are expensive for what they are (the gigantic baked mac and cheese offers the best value).",hotel

The shuttle will also collect you from your hotel with advance notice. The fee for the shuttle bus and park admission is combined and includes a glass of tea and guided tour.",hotel
"Regency Hotel. Bathrooms here are spotless and beds have crisp, clean linen, but rooms are unlikely to inspire prose on your Facebook page and the overwhelming feel is slightly old-fashioned (think a four-star motel circa 1990). Its main selling points are its ace location, professional service and wide array of facilities, including a restaurant and a well-tended swimming pool at the back.",hotel

"Visiting Halong Bay: tips to plan your cruise. Budget and midrange cruises : Most Halong Bay visitors go for midrange or budget cruises, but there is a huge range when it comes to price and value for money. At one end of the scale are some ultra-budget boats where conditions are rustic at best; at the other are some excellent midrange options offering cosy hotel-style cabins, knowledgeable on-board tour guides and kayaking stops. If purse strings are tight, for facilities, comfort and safety considerations, it’s sometimes better to choose a day cruise with a midrange operator rather than a bargain-basement overnight trip.",hotel

Choose where to stay: a neighborhood guide  : Downtown has most of the business and design-savvy hotels, but modest eating and drinking action after dark. Next door Midtown buzzes with restaurants and nightlife and is near cultural attractions, though fewer hotels, with apartment rentals taking up the slack. Corktown and West Village are still full of bars and cafes, but somewhat further from the core; it’s probably best to have a car if you're lodging in these areas. Book accommodations a month or so in advance, if possible.",hotel
"I've lived in Chicago for 31 years - here's what visitors need to know. Choose where to stay : Downtown has loads of cool architectural hotels near the sights, but limited eating and drinking options after dark. Next door the Near North has hotels and evening action, but it’s pricey and a bit cookie-cutter. The West Loop, Lincoln Park, Lake View and Wicker Park all have abundant nightlife.

"Why you should consider staying in an airport hotel. During peak times they can also be cheaper than accommodation in the city itself, and all you need is a travel pass to see the sights. They’re often better connected to public transport networks than many hotels in the city, and just having the public transport card zone that goes all the way out to the airport makes you more likely to explore more of the city than just having the central zones. Plus, public transport is a great way to peoplewatch.",hotel

"Al Khobaar Lake Resort. 'Resort' is a misnomer for Al Khobaar as there's no hotel or any other facility here warranting that description. For some this may mean it's of limited interest, but for others, it makes it heaven.

"Paradise Island Resort & Spa. The atmosphere, though, is hardly intimate: you’re crowded onto one of the country’s biggest island resorts. If you want seclusion and true escape, go elsewhere. Rooms are distinctly simple, with white tiles, white walls and satellite TV. They are absolutely fine, but unlikely to be places where you’ll want to spend much of your time. By contrast, the 62 high-end rooms in the Haven development, a sort of resort within a resort, come in four categories. They are very sleek, stylish and rather minimalist, the higher categories coming with enormous slate pools and all having large sun terraces with direct access to the water. However, given that Haven's prices are comparable to other more intimate, less mass-market resorts, its appeal is perhaps limited.",resort

The luxury resort is all-inclusive and the stay begins when travellers arrive in Singapore, where they are picked up by a private chauffeur and taken to Batam International Airport, where they take an 80-minute ride on an amphibious seaplane. Once they arrive on the lush island, all the spa treatments and guest experiences are included in the price, which the resort claims makes it the only retreat in Asia to be truly all-inclusive.

"Corozo Blue's. The waterfront location at this semi-enclosed, stone-hewn restaurant and day resort is unbeatable, with indoor, beachfront and garden seating offering a spectacular view of the bay. It's popular for the stone-oven wood-fired pizzas, late breakfasts and formidable steaks, but also burgers and Belize standards such as rice and beans and ceviche.",resort
"Finn Lough. There are also three rooms in the main house, and self-catering cottages sleeping six people, some with great water views.

"Fijiâ€™s top resorts for romance. There are plenty of Fiji resorts that entirely devote themselves to welcoming lovebirds with some serious island pampering, so you and your other half can enjoy all the private beaches, sandspit picnics and romantic sunsets you could dream of. Best of all, many Fijian resorts are small and intimate, some with fewer than 20 rooms, so you can really escape the crowds and make the most of your one-on-one time. Some resorts specialize in spas and wellness activities, while others offer an array of activities including scuba diving, river rafting and rainforest treks.",resort

"16 things you never knew about London. ...but almost all the city’s rivers are : The Thames is a majestic thing, rising and falling with the tides as though the city itself is inhaling and exhaling, but its topographical dominance can distract from the fact that it’s just one (albeit a mighty one) of many London rivers. To be fair, all the others are small tributaries, long since built over and now mostly hidden deep below street level. The majority slip quietly into the Thames from some gloomy riverbank tunnel, like the River Fleet, whose exit can be seen under the northside of Blackfriars Bridge if you crane your neck at low tide.",river
"These 11 Irish castles showcase the dramatic beauty of historic Ireland. 11. Donegal Castle : Donegal Castle guards a picturesque bend of the River Esque in Donegal.

"10 classic sailing adventures. 6. Nile River, Egypt : For millennia the Nile was Egypt’s main transport corridor, and today’s travellers get the perfect chance to get off-road and sail into history. For multi-day river jaunts, budget-friendly feluccas (small, traditional canvas-sailed boats) and dahabiyyas (more-luxurious houseboats, which have become the Rolls Royce of the Nile) have it all over the big cruisers. They use sail power instead of engines so more time is spent on the river, and they can stop at small islands or antiquities sites that are skipped by the cruise boats.",river
"Voyages of a lifetime. 8. The Yangtze by slow boat : A cruise down China's Yangtze, the world’s third-longest river, is one of the most memorable water-borne journeys on earth.

"Wild Lake. A 3km trail called Pot ob Rakah follows the Idrijca River Canal from the Kamšt (an 18th-century waterwheel used by the mines) to Wild Lake, a tiny, impossibly green lake fed by a deep karst spring.

"Awe-inspiring ancient sites of wild western Iran. Aras River Valley : Forming Iran’s northern border with Azerbaijan and Armenia, which are still technically in conflict over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, the scenically imposing Aras River Valley has played host to traders, spies and marauding armies since biblical times. Safe inside a line of watchtowers, the road along the dramatic southern Iranian bank meanders spectacularly through mudbrick villages, crumbling ruins and soaring jagged peaks. Whether the Aras is actually the River Gihon from the Garden of Eden is debatable, but it’s obvious that the northern bank, with its bombed-out stations, abandoned trains and barricaded tunnels, is no paradise.",river

"Ask an expert: longhaul paddleboarding with Lizzie Carr. At its most basic all you need is a board, a leash, a buoyancy aid and a paddle. That’s part of the beauty of it. Because the board is inflatable you can put it in a rucksack and go on a hike. In England’s Lake District, I’ve hiked up to Derwent Water, pumped up the board and just gone to the little islands. Or you can go island hopping around the Isles of Scilly, one of my favourite places to take my SUP. Paddle boarding gives me a sense of freedom and escape. Even living in a city, you can head out onto rivers and canals where you’re far enough away from land for the sights and sounds to be muffled. You’re still immersed in the natural environment, but in a completely different way.",river
"Chicago's newly reopened Maritime Museum aims to salvage the city's neglected sea history. At the end of the 19th century, with the help of a system of canals and locks, the city pulled off one of the great engineering feats of the day by reversing the flow of the Chicago River. Instead of draining into Lake Michigan, this short and otherwise unremarkable waterway now connected with the Des Plaines River to flow into the Mississippi basin, and eventually into the Gulf of Mexico and the rest of the world.",river

"Fort Phantom Hill. Boredom rather than combat doomed this 1851 fort along the clear fork of the Brazos River. Fort Phantom Hill was among the outposts constructed to protect settlers on the Texas frontier; it was abandoned just three years later after droves of bored soldiers left it (and the service). Today, visitors will find only a handful of buildings and about a dozen chimneys among the windy, lonely ruins. Fort Phantom Hill is on private land but the site is open during daylight hours. The grounds are 11 miles north of I-20 on FM 600 (a total of 14 miles north of Abilene). Nearby Lake Fort Phantom is popular for picnicking.",river
"The USA's top 5 National Wild and Scenic Rivers. Buffalo National River, Arkansas : The Buffalo was the first river in the country to receive the designation of National River, and its 135 miles make up one of the last undammed river systems in the lower 48 states. The river runs through prime Ozark country, and across what was historically Osage land. After occupation by European settlers, the region around the Buffalo became a hub for homesteaders, miners and timber companies, later serving as the staging ground for guerilla skirmishes during the Civil War.",river
"Best places in the Southern US to beat the summer heat. Buffalo National River – Arkansas : This river is one of the only ones in the lower 48 states to flow freely without interruption from a dam, and it's the first one to receive designation as a National River. It winds for 135 miles through northern Arkansas, passing by sheer granite cliffs and other fascinating geology formed over thousands of years of interaction between the area’s limestone karst landscape and bodies of water. You’ll want to take your time and soak it all in, as the river is surprisingly clear – float along the cerulean waterway in a kayak or canoe through the Buffalo’s upper, middle or lower districts.",river

"Elephant Trunk Hill. Cormorant fishing in the Li River is a tourist drawcard, though there is some question about the welfare of the birds and the ethicality of this ancient custom. This custom has been practised in China for more than a millennium, and though it was formerly a successful industry, its main use today is to entertain tourists. It involves the fisherman tying a snare near the base of the bird's throat so that the bird can swallow smaller fish, but not larger ones. When a cormorant has caught a large fish, the fisherman brings the bird back to the boat and the cormorant spits the fish out.",river

"Grotta di Ispinigoli. Discovered by a shepherd in 1950, the caves weren’t explored in earnest until the 1960s. A deep network of 15km of caves with eight subterranean rivers has since been found. Cavers can book tours of up to 8km through one of the various tour organisers in Dorgali or Cala Gonone. Nuraghe artefacts were discovered on the floor of the main well, and Phoenician jewellery on the floor of the second main ‘well’, another 40m below. On the standard tour you can just peer into the hole that leads into this second cavity, known also as the Abbisso delle Vergini (Abyss of the Virgins). The ancient jewellery found has led some to believe that the Phoenicians launched young girls into the pit in rites of human sacrifice.",river

"Dominica: adventures on the Caribbean's 'Nature Island'. It’s not all about the saltwater, even though the island is, of course, surrounded by it. With opportunities to cool off in Dominica’s waterfalls and rivers (it’s said that the island has a river for every day of the year), fans of freshwater sources have more than enough choices. Guided boat tours on the Indian River cruise beneath the jungle canopy next to thickly buttressed bwa mang trees and often end over rum drinks at riverside bars with your boat captain (mine was named Fire).

"Riverfront. It’s supremely pleasant to stroll up to the Mississippi River as it runs by the Quarter. The entire riverfront area has been landscaped with pedestrian paths, public arts projects and small green spaces such as the Woldenberg Park.

"The most striking newly-unveiled architecture from 2017. Located in Aalborg on the largest fjord landscape in the country, the 100,000-square-foot Vestre Fjord Park was unveiled last summer. The vision behind the project is to encourage direct contact to the fjord by establishing better accessibility from land and sea. Designed by Adept architects, the park strives to be a balance between the natural landscape and the activities and functions of daily users. The park is divided into several smaller landscape areas, each with their own identity and character. It includes a beach zone that embraces open-air swimming and has a springboard for diving, a woods and wetlands area that has vegetation, and a plain built for physical activity.",swimming
"MakapuÊ»u Beach Park. Makapuʻu Beach is one of Oʻahu’s top bodyboarding and bodysurfing spots, but as with Sandy Beach Park, Makapuʻu is strictly the domain of experts who can handle rough water and dangerous currents.

The beach park has restrooms, outdoor showers, drinking water and lifeguards, and the beach is a short walk from the car park.",swimming

The main attractions are Big Lagoon, Small Lagoon and Secret Lagoon, three of the more photographed sights in all of Palawan. Big Lagoon is entered by an extremely shallow channel (you may have to swim into the lagoon and leave the boat outside). Inside, surrounded by jungle-clad karst walls, is an enormous natural swimming hole.",swimming
"Learning to freedive in Indonesia. Most freediving training involves swimming vertically down a drop line in the open ocean. There's the big blue around you but you're concentrating on freedive technique rather than searching reefs for exotic sealife. Everyone got down to 8m by the end of the course, and two of us reached 20m. Later we used our training to explore Sunset Reef off Gili Trawangan, where we spotted three hawksbill turtles (fellow, if far more advanced, freedivers).",swimming
"The 10 best wild swimming spots in the UK. My love of taking a dip stems from regular swims in London’s Hampstead Ponds and an obsession with Waterlog, the late naturalist Roger Deakin’s classic book about the joys of wild swimming. My own book, Floating: A Life Regained, retraced Deakin’s seminal text, and took me across the UK in a search for invigorating swims and a chance to feel the cool, calming effect of the water for hours after I’d dried off and headed home.",swimming

"Wild swimming in Britain. 'Outdoor swimming offers an eccentrically English day,' She explains. 'You can head into the country, have a dip and have a picnic. Once you get in the water you see the country in a new light'. Though river swimming is an ancient pastime, with a pool (see ukstudentlife.com) on the River Cam in Grantchester, near Cambridge named after Lord Byron, Kate also suggests that today’s swimmers are adding a pioneering element. If you’re by the water this summer, you might just see some intrepid-looking types in swimming kit looking for a good place to jump in.",swimming
"Valencia and Alicante: beaches, barrios and otherworldly buildings. Playa de las Arenas : One of Valencia’s biggest joys is its proximity to the beach – from the city centre, it’s a quick 3km bus or tram ride to huge expanses of golden sand that stretch for 4km along the coast. Playa de las Arenas is a popular choice, but since it's 100 metres wide, there’s more than enough room here for everyone, plus plenty of eating and drinking options. If you work up an appetite swimming then stop at Portolito for lunch – it’s a decent place to try local speciality fideuà, which is similar to paella, but made with fine pasta instead of rice.",swimming
"Afterburn: how to salvage a beach holiday after a painful start. Protected swimming : There are still several options for enjoying a day in the water after you've burned yourself like a cheap meatloaf. The no-brainer option is a covered swimming pool at a hotel, but some destinations have alternatives like spas, water parks, and even cool water tubs. (It should go without saying, but DO NOT get into a hot tub while sunburned!) Then there are the natural protected options, like swimming in the caves and cenotes of Mexico. Lastly, one can always (gingerly) wriggle into a full-body wetsuit and snorkel/scuba the day away.",swimming

While Allas Sea Pools and Löyly are the hip spots, I prefer the unassuming Kulttuurisauna, where genders are separated to allow for nudity, the most comfortable way to be in a sweatbox.

"Wild swimming in Britain. Swimming is, by nature, a simple sport. You don’t need masses of kit. 'You can go in wearing your pants,' notes Rew. The water probably won’t get much above 18 or 19ºC unless the weather is very warm, and it’s a good idea to swim with someone else. There’s not much need to worry about access: most water you can see you can swim in legally, though you do need to be wary about trespassing on land, rather than in the water.

Swimming is possible at the falls themselves (compulsory life jackets are provided for ₹40), but don’t picture yourself taking a romantic swim on your own – there will be plenty of other bathers joining in.

"Worth a trip: Northwest England's Morecambe Bay. Take the plunge into the bay  : Morecambe rose to fame thanks to its beach – and you can still enjoy a swim here. Plenty of local coves and beaches still beckon, though because of the constantly changing sands and often unpredictable tides, it’s safest to check in with local swimming groups like M.A.L.L.O.W.S. first to find exactly out where and when to swim safely each day.

"The best things to do in Riviera Maya: ancient ruins, magical caverns and tree-top adventures. The compact archaeological site can be seen in a couple of hours; aim to get here before the tour groups arrive at 11 am and bring a swimsuit for a refreshing dip in the inviting water beneath the ruins. There is very little shade at the ruins and the opportunity to cool off in the sea is most welcome.

"Ask LP Kids: why are family vacations so important?. It's no surprise that here at Lonely Planet Kids we think vacations are a very important part of family life and if you're reading this then you probably agree.

"Ask LP Kids: why are family vacations so important?. The expert view : Family vacations are essential because they give us the opportunity to unplug, unwind, and reconnect with each other. Whether it’s a bike ride down to the tip of Long Beach Island or a rainy hike through the foliage of Puerto Rico’s El Yunque, our best memories are of times spent exploring a new place together. I believe the most important thing to remember about family vacations is that they do not need to be extravagant. It’s not the luxury of the accommodations or the numbers of stars on the restaurant rating that matters to your kids—it’s the time spent together.",with kids

"Family travel snap: climbing ruins in Mexico. I love this picture because it represents the next level of travelling that we can do with our kids. Seeing their faces at the top when they accomplished something they had set out to do was priceless. In fact, that memory is possibly even better than the incredible view. It demonstrated to us how much more fun we are going to have travelling with our children as they get older; not only because of their changing abilities and the additional experiences we can have together, but also watching them grow by learning about new cultures and pushing their physical limitations.",with kids

"Will having child-free zones on airplanes become a reality on US flights?. Good point, but as well as appealing to child-free passengers, many believe that creating separate seating for children might reduce the stress some parents feel when travelling with children. New parents often get anxious that their children will become upset during a flight and disrupt fellow passengers, and A-list stars are no exception. Worried that their twin babies would make a fuss during a flight to England, Hollywood star George Clooney and his international law and human rights barrister wife, Amal, give free noise-cancelling headphones to neighbouring passengers.",with kids

"Travelling with kids on Queensland's Capricorn Coast. Returning to Queensland with kids : The first thing I learned the second time around was that kids don't care where they are as long as they’re comfortable, fed and rested. We celebrated this revelation by loitering in Noosa for a week longer than planned before embarking on our road trip, heading north up the Capricorn Coast. We got lost on purpose up the Everglades, swam beneath koalas at Tea Tree Bay and took the Rainbow Beach barge out to Fraser Island. For children, an island feeds the imagination; it's a self-contained world with visible boundaries to stand on the edge of and guffaw.",with kids

Split into two areas, the garden allows kids to enjoy exploring and interacting with nature based on their age group. Under 6’ers have their own dry and wet playground that is surrounded by dense gardens so big kids can’t easily run in. The highlight for older kids will be the rainforest tree houses; surrounded by awesome play equipment like climbing ropes, spider net and twisting slide, it’s where jungle fantasies come to life. When it’s time to cool off, head to the water area where kids will love the water effects sequenced to their movements.",with kids
"Responsible volunteering: things to know before you go. Finally, always ask yourself this question when volunteering. 'If it was your child, grandchild, brother or sister in that situation, what kind of volunteering would be ok/not ok?  There are so many people who want to spend an hour at an orphanage,' says Karen. 'People take fluffy toys - and lollies - and go and kick a ball with the kids.'

"How to survive a city trip with kids. Sure, city trips with kids may involve fewer cocktails, leisurely meals and lazy mornings than they might do otherwise, but that’s not to say they can’t be wonderfully fun and stress-free.

"Best culture trips for families. Norway : Scandinavian culture has been on trend for travellers for many years, but funky design and cutting-edge gastronomy are not attractions you necessarily associate with children. However, thanks to family-friendly resorts and the fact that kids under eight go free, Norway is increasingly popular for families introducing their children to that popular Scandinavian activity: skiing.

"Wild times: outdoor adventures for every family.

"How to fit travel into a busy family schedule . Bring the kids on some trips, leave 'em on others : If my kids had their way, every vacation would include putt-putt, bunk beds and a swimming pool. While we cherish entertaining these interests, their dad and I also have interests (gasp!), and they include – well -- hikes longer than a mile and leisurely dinners with cocktails rather than crayons.

""I find in my family-based classes and events that kids crave unscheduled, unscripted time in the outdoors,"" she says. ""Find a location, create a base camp, and encourage free play.

"Whatâ€™s the fastest way to board a plane? Gatwick Airport wants to find out. Now, your question might be “but what if I’m travelling with my other half or as a family?” After all, imagine if Little Timmy has 30A, one of his mums has 30B, but the rest of the family are on the other side of the aisle in 30E and 30F. The answer for that, Gatwick tells me, is that families — as well as people who need additional assistance to board — will be allowed to preboard with passengers who’ve bought one of the packages like easyJet’s Speedy Boarding. That’s all well and good — I don’t have kids myself but I think every passenger would agree that anything to make happy, settled, chilled-out kids who have everything they need to occupy themselves quietly for the flight is a big plus, and if it means that their accompanying adults can enjoy a relaxed beverage then that’s so much the better..",with kids
"How to plan the perfect big family holiday.

"Why you should still travel with children who are too young to remember it . It helps their brains develop  : We know toddlers are sponges. My three-year-old still remembers the name of a Finnish friend who took him sledding in Rovaniemi last winter. There's no doubt that the stimulation of new experiences – whether reading a book at home, visiting the zoo or hitting the road – is good for kids. When I travel with my children, it automatically means less screen time as we navigate new surrounds away from our predictable routine. It’s a form of bonding that’s good for their brains and also good for our family. They might not remember or care about seeing the Eiffel Tower, but plan an immersive experience around it – unpacking a picnic basket and sitting in the grass to try a new cheese – and you’ve anchored in a glorious new moment instead of plodding through your usual day-to-day. ",with kids

"Best things to do with kids in England. Is England a good place to visit with kids? : One of the greatest things about traveling with kids in England is that many museums aimed specifically at families are free to visit, allowing for a cheaper full-day experience with hands-on learning. The majority of cafes and restaurants welcome children, offering smaller portions, changing facilities and high chairs. This applies to many pubs too, although be sure to check with the bar staff if it's not immediately obvious.
