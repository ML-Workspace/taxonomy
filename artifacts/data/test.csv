"St Augustine Church. Open since 1841, ‘St Aug’s’ is the oldest African American Catholic church in the country, a place where Creoles, émigrés from St Domingue and free persons of color could worship shoulder to shoulder, even as separate pews were designated for slaves. Call ahead to see if it’s possible to arrange a visit. Don’t miss the Tomb of the Unknown Slave, fashioned to resemble a grim cross assembled from chain links.",church
"The world's most expensive macaron costs almost US$10k, but comes complete with a luxury hotel stay. Macarons have become a real thing all over the world, but they're usually an inexpensive treat. Brace yourselves though at the news that the Crystal Macaron is available for $9703 from the St. Regis Bal Harbour Resort in Florida. The good news is that the most expensive macaron in the world comes with an overnight stay at one of the hotel's four-bedroom Sky Palace Suites, which house up to eight guests.",expensive
"Camden Bar. Behind the bland wall facing a side street, this bar is a fine place to retreat for an evening. You can chill in the woodsy air-con lounge or take in the air outside on the terrace. Beer prices are good and there's a wide range of cocktails, Scotch, bourbon and single malt whiskies, plus a range of bar food.",bar
"Things to do in Honolulu without spending a dime. Kawaiahaʻo Church : Often regarded in the past as the ""Westminster Abbey of Hawaii,"" Oʻahu’s oldest church was built on the site where the first missionaries constructed a grass thatch church shortly after their arrival in 1820. The original structure seated 300 Hawaiians on lauhala mats, woven from hala (screwpine) leaves. This 1842 New England Georgian (Palladian) style church is made of 14,000 coral slabs, which divers chiseled out of Oʻahu’s underwater reefs – a weighty task that took four years.",church

"3 great ways to see live music in Japan . 2. Live houses : Live houses are everywhere in Japan - but not at street level. These places like to play it cool. Dig around and you'll find bizarre punk bands with names like Mass of the Fermenting Dregs, Vomit Remnants and Booted Cocks blasting away in tiny darkened basement rooms. Save your applause until the very end of the set, not after each song, as that would be uncouth. Live houses generally have a cover charge of around ¥1000-2000 and in most cases you get a drink ticket with it. On a tight travel budget? Stop off at a kombini (convenience store) en route to the gig and stock up on some takeaway beers. That's right; some live houses, such as Namba Bears in Osaka, are BYO.",live music

"The 6 best day trips from Prague . Best for castle grandeur : The main event here is Karlštejn Castle, a gleaming 14th-century castle rising dramatically from the countryside beside the Berounka River, a half hour drive south from Prague. This Disney-esque fantasy of a castle can trace its roots all the way back to 1348 and the reign of Prague’s own Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, and the building was conceived as a hiding place for the Bohemian crown jewels in times of war.",river
"Daea Ulleung Resort. The island’s most expensive property, this impressive resort has amazing mountaintop views of the sea, but the rooms are overpriced for what they are: unexciting and smallish, albeit perfectly comfortable and clean. From mid-July to August there’s an outdoor swimming pool, and room prices spike. The hotel is in Sadong-ri, a ₩5000 taxi ride from Dodong-ri.",expensive
"Why cycling is the future of urban transportation around the world . The benefits of biking : Embracing cyclists may create a silver lining for cities dealing with the on-going health crisis. According to the Dutch Cycling Embassy, biking to work every day reduces depression and cuts serious health risks like heart disease and cancer in half. In Copenhagen, where 43% of people commute by bike, cyclists avoid 20,000 tons of carbon emissions annually by abandoning private passenger vehicles. ",road cycling
"The 10 best beaches in Sri Lanka. Dalawella : Just east of Unawatuna, much-photographed Frog Rock presides over Dalawella’s slender champagne sands.

It’s a super spot for families, particularly as curious turtles often make an appearance.",beach

"17 top adventures in and around mighty Moab . Explore the Fiery Furnace : There are more than 2000 documented arches in small but mighty Arches National Park. Delicate Arch is by far the most photographed and most visited, but to get beyond the crowds, head out with the rangers for an informative guided tour of the Fiery Furnace. In this natural warren of arches and canyons, you’ll find amazing secret passages, hidden corners, and remarkable glimpses of the flora and fauna that thrive in this harsh desert environment. You’ll need to book the free ranger-led hikes ahead of time; during the shoulder season, they sometimes offer permits for self-guided walks, but it's easy to get lost, so we advise a guide.",nature tours
"St Etheldreda's. More than just a gorgeous oasis of peace, this stunner of a church is also the oldest Roman Catholic church in the UK, dating from the reign of Edward I. The town chapel of the Bishops of Ely dates from the mid-13th century to 1570 and is named after the 7th-century East Anglian princess and Fenland saint Etheldreda. The church was saved during the Great Fire of London by an abrupt change in the wind.",church

"Under the radar USA: Cheyenne, Wyoming, gateway to the parks. Todd Thibodeau of Wyoming State Parks worked with the International Mountain Biking Association (IMBA) to develop the trail system in the early 2000’s. He drew from his ski patroller experience in Breckenridge, Colorado, where trails vary from green circles to black diamond slopes. Gowdy was one of the first mountain bike parks to adopt this ski-area model, and the IMBA was excited to work on the empty canvas – Gowdy’s 1,000 acres of land.",mountain biking
"10 reasons to visit Latvia. Ancient castles : When German warrior monks pushed into the Baltics in the early 13th century, introducing the locals to the joys of Christianity with the pointy end of their swords, they couldn’t be certain of a warm welcome. Sturdy fortifications were a necessary precaution and castles sprang up throughout the land, many of which are still standing today. Visitors to Cēsis Castle are issued with a candle-powered lantern to explore the darker recesses of its ruined walls. The boxy Livonian Order Castle in Ventspils, by contrast, has been restored and converted into an excellent interactive museum.",museum

"Visiting Halong Bay: tips to plan your cruise. Budget and midrange cruises : Most Halong Bay visitors go for midrange or budget cruises, but there is a huge range when it comes to price and value for money. At one end of the scale are some ultra-budget boats where conditions are rustic at best; at the other are some excellent midrange options offering cosy hotel-style cabins, knowledgeable on-board tour guides and kayaking stops. If purse strings are tight, for facilities, comfort and safety considerations, it’s sometimes better to choose a day cruise with a midrange operator rather than a bargain-basement overnight trip.",hotel
